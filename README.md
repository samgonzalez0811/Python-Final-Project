# Python-Final-Project
This is my final project assignment for my Intro to Python course that I took at Fullerton College.
This project had me create a GUI that takes in Employee data from the user and then saves it within a 
database. I got a small introduction to sqlite3 which taught me how to create a database. It then taught me
how to select, insert, update, and delete information from a SQL database. This project is a accumulation of
what I learned from this intro course.

Description of Project:
The GUI asks the user to input 10 items that is related to Employee data then once you press save its puts it 
into the database. When the user presses load it loads the first instance of Employee data inputted, and then 
allows you to scroll through other instances of Employee data. It then allows you to clear the input bars for 
the user to add more and then close out the GUI when the user is done.
